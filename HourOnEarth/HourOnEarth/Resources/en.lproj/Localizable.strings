"tridoshic_paragraph1" = "Although quite rare, some individuals have all 3 doshas in more or less equal strengths. They are categorized as tridoshic or Vata-Pitta-Kapha type individuals. With this naturally balanced Prakriti or dosha type, they are more likely to find a harmonious balance in life and can be meditative, fit, healthy, and emotionally stable.";

"tridoshic_paragraph2" = "This balance characterizes almost every aspect of life. Tridoshic individuals tend to be of a medium build and frame, with a pleasant disposition and sharp minds that can still find mental peace. The only scenario in which problems arise is when such individuals go against their basic nature throwing their doshas out of balance. Disorders that are associated with the aggravated dosha then begin to surface. For example, aggravation of Vata can give rise to problems like digestive and sleep disorders, while aggravation of Kapha could cause problems with excess body weight and depression.";

"kapha_vata_paragraph1" = "The Kapha-Vata combination type is perhaps the most interesting because of the opposing nature of the 2 doshas that are in predominance – Kapha and Vata. While Kapha dosha gives rise to a desire for stability, order, and routine, Vata triggers more creative pursuits and a more enthusiastic and chaotic approach to life. This strange combination can give rise to serious internal conflicts, leading to plenty of frustration at times.";

Kapha-Vata individuals also have greater vulnerability to a number of health conditions, including poor digestion with problems like bloating and constipation. Kapha-Vata individuals also have conflicting emotions, alternating between being laidback and anxious, as well as sleeping excessively or poorly. They also have a higher risk of stone formation, loss of focus, depression, and other disorders. This makes balancing dosha levels critical, as this is essential to mitigate the risk of poor health.";

In balanced individuals, the fiery energy of pitta is kept grounded and balanced by Kapha. This means that individuals in this dosha type are less likely to experience digestive health problems early in life, as they have the perfect strength of Agni or digestive fire.
